  <h1>Adventure Academy is permanently closed</h1>
  <p>Due to state budget cuts for childcare subsidies, our center has been forced to permanently close. As a result of these cuts, dozens of daycares around the state have also been forced to permanently close, limiting childcare for all children in Indiana, not just those who directly participated in the program. Even prior to these budget cuts, Indiana has been ranked 50th in the United States with regards access to early childhood care. </p>
  <br />
  <p>We encourage you to take action this November and to vote for future Indiana leaders who understand the value of quality education and care for children early in life. Thank you for all the wonderful memories over the years. Don't allow our children to fall behind!
